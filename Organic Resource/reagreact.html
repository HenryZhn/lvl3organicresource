							Substitution
						</h3>
						<h3>
							Explanation of Substitution
						</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Substitution reactions are reactions where one group is substituted for another. For example, a hydrogen can be substituted with a hydroxyl group.
							</li>
						</ul>
						<h3>
							Reagents
						</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Thionoyl Chloride (SOCl2): Used to substitute chlorine atoms onto compounds. PCL 3 or 5 can be used as an alternative. To react, the reaction usually needs to be under reflux. 
							</li>
							<li>
								Alcoholic Ammonia (or Concentrated Ammonia): Used to form amines or amides, depending on the reaction. It must be dissolved in alcohol. Alternativly, this may be refered to as conc. ammonia.
							</li>
							<li>
								Haloalkane: An alkane with one or more halogens bonded instead of the usual hydrogen. They are more reactive than the usual alkane due to the increased reactivity of the halogen, and can be used in many substitution or elimination reactions as a precursor to other molecules.
							</li>
							<li>
								Aqueous KOH: Can substitute a halogen group for a hydroxy (OH) group to form primary, secondary, or tertiary alcohols.
							</li>
							<li>
								Water: Reacts with Acid Chlorides in a substitution reaction, where the Cl group is substituted with a hydroxyl group, and the Cl reacts with the hydrogen molecule to form hydrochloric acid.
							</li>
							<li>
								Amines: Can react with molecules with a halogen group to form an amide.
							</li>

							Oxidation

							Condensation/Esterification Reactions
						</h3>
						<h3>
							Explanation of Reaction and Reagents
						</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>
								The esterification/condensation reaction is one that involves the condensing of either a carboxylic acid or an acid chloride and an alcohol into an ester.
							</li>
							<li>
								If the reagents are an alcohol and a carboxylic acid, the reaction would require concentrated suphuric acid and heat, and will occur under reflux. This reaction involves the carboxylic acid losing its OH/hydroxyl group, which forms a water molecule with the hydrogen lost by the hydroxyl group on the alcohol. The oxygen then joins the two molecules together into an ester.
							</li>
							<li>
								If the reagents are an acid chloride and a carboxylic acid, the reaction does not need any special conditions to occur. The chlorine atom joins with the hydrogen atom from the hydroxyl group of the alcohol to form HCl, and the oxygen becomes the joining oxygen of the ester.
							</li>

							Elimination Reactions
						</h3>
						<h3>
							Common Reagents
						</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Concentrated (.conc) Sulphuric Acid: Sulphuric acid is a dehydrating agent, meaning that it removes water. Functionally, in elimination reactions, it can remove the OH group and another hydrogen atom from an alcohol. This results in an alkene, with a double bond forming between the two carbons that have lost a group.
							</li>
							<li>
								Alcoholic Potassium Hydroxide: When in reflux, alcoholic potassium hydroxide reacts with the halogen in a haloalkane and another hydrogen atom on the molecule, eliminating them to form a potassium salt and water. This results in a alkene due to the double bond that forms between the carbons that have lost an atom/bond.
							</li>
						</ul>
						<h3>
							Zaitsev's Rule (IDK, there are like 10 different spellings for his name)
						</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Zaitsev's rule is the rule that determines the major and minor product of an elimination reaction. In short, it can be remebered as "The poor get poorer."
							</li>
							<li>
								Zaitsev's rule states that, in an elimination reaction, a carbon with less hydrogen atoms bonded to it is more likely to lose it. This is known as the "Major Product."
							</li>
							<li>
								For example, if a molecule of butan-2-ol undergoes elimination, carbon 3 will be more likely to lose a hydrogen atom than carbon 1, as carbon 1 has 3 hydrogen atoms while carbon 3 has only 2. This means that but-2-ene will be the major product, while but-1-ene is the minor.
							</li>
							<li>
								Note that the major product is only the product that is most likely to form, and that the minor product can still form, only that it does so less of the time.
							</li>

							Hydrolysis
						</h3>
						<h3>
							Explanation of Hydrolysis
						</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Hydrolysis referes to the splitting apart of an ester into a carboxylic acid and an alcohol. However, depending on the conditions these reactions take place under, the products may react further to form other products.
							</li>
							<li>
								Hydrolysis may also occur if an ester reacts with alcoholic ammonia, in which case a primary amide and an alcohol will be formed
							</li>
							<li>
								When reacting with water under acidic conditions, the ester splits into a carboxylic acid and an alcohol, while under basic conditions, the ester splits into a carboxylate salt and an alcohol. This is because the acidic carboxilic acid reacts with the base in an acid base reaction as soon as it is formed.
							</li>
							<li>
								When hydrolysis occurs with alcoholic ammonia, the result is a primary amide and an alcohol. This is because the ammonia molecule loses one hydrogen, which is bonded to the joining oxygen of the ester, which stays with the alcohol, while the NH2- binds to the other carbon, forming a primary amide.
							</li>
							<li>
								Note that the products from hydrolysis are formed from the carboxylic acid and alcohol constituents of the ester.
							</li>
						</ul>

							Addition
						</h3>
						<h3>
							Explanation of Addition Reactions + Markovnikov's Rule
						</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Addition reactions are reactions where more groups are added to a molecule, and typically involve the breaking of a double bond between two carbons in an alkene.
							</li>
							<li>
								Addition reactions, like elimination reactions, can have major and minor products. These are determined by Markovnikov's Rule, which in short, states that "The rich get richer."
							</li>
							<li>
								Markovnikov's rule states that in an addition reaction, the carbons that are most likely to gain a hydrogen are those with the most hydrogens already bonded to it. This is the major product of an addition reaction.
							</li>
							<li>
								The minor product, which forms less often, is the product that does not follow this rule.
							</li>
						</ul>
						<h3>
							Reactants
						</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Hydrogen Gas: For an addition reaction with hydrogen gas to occur, a catalyst is required. This is usually platinum or nickle.
							</li>
							<li>
								Hydrochloric Acid: Creates a chloroalkane.
							</li>
							<li>
								Acidified Water: Creates an alcohol.
							</li>
							<li>
								Bromine: Creates dibromoalkane.
							</li>
						</ul>

							Acid Base Reactions
						</h3>
						<h3>
							Explanation of Reaction + Reactants
						</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>
								These are very simple reactions, and for this standard, they usually take place between a carboxylic acid and a base.
							</li>
							<li>
								The products of these reactions are a carboxylate salt and water.
							</li>
							<li>
								Note that ammonia is a base, meaning it will react with carboxylate acids to form ammonium carboxylate.
							</li>
						</ul>

							Reduction Reactions
						</h3>
						<h3>
							Explanation of Reduction Reactions
						</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Reduction is the gain of electrons. Functionally, in organics, this is the gaining of bonds with hydrogen atoms for oxygen atoms, which are themselves double bonded to a carbon. This reaction causes the oxygen to break one of the bonds with the carbon to form a new bond with a hydrogen, resulting in the formation of an hydroxyl (OH) group, or an alcohol.
							</li>
							<li>
								For organics, ketones and aldehydes are able to undergo reduction. This results in the formation of primary alcohols for aldehydes, and secondary alcohols for ketones.
							</li>
						</ul>
						<h3>
							Reagents
						</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>
								There is only one reagent for this, Sodium Brohydride.
